# LSD-Models
This repository stores models developed for specific projects that authors want to share with the public. Each directory contains one model, generally containing documentation, such as the reference to a paper based on a model, and the files required to replicate the results.
All the models can be executed using the platform LSD available here: www.github.com/marcov64/lsd
